2. **Recommended specifications:**
   - **Format**: JPG or PNG
   - **Size**: At least 300x300 pixels (square aspect ratio works best)
   - **File size**: Under 2MB for optimal loading
   - **Quality**: High resolution for crisp display

## Other Images

You can also add other images here for:
- Project screenshots
- Resume/CV documents
- Any other assets you want to use in your portfolio

## File Structure

```
public/images/

## Tips

- **Profile Image**: Make sure it's a professional headshot with good lighting
- **File Names**: Use lowercase letters and avoid spaces (use hyphens or underscores)
- **Optimization**: Compress images before adding them to keep your site fast
- **Backup**: Keep original high-quality versions of your images elsewhere

## Fallback

If no `profile.jpg` is found, the website will show a placeholder with instructions on how to add your photo.
